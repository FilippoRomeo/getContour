# getContour
This python script uses Opencv to get the shape of an object and output how many side it has. 
I advice put objcets on a background with a different color and to use a to use a web cam with a usb camble. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FilippoRomeo/getContour
cd getContour
python3 getContour.py
```
